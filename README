C++ Id3 Tag utility to write id3 tags to an audio file. 
The tags can be read from a json file.

Currenty this only works with AIFF files. 

This requires both taglib and jsonlib. 

TagLib: http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
jsonlib: https://github.com/thanatos/libjson

Thanks to both those projects to make this one possible.
